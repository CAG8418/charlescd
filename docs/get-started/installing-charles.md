# Installing Charles

{% hint style="info" %}
The installing process was created considering some use cases, and each of them have its own specific tutorial. If you need to install CharlesCD in a different way, we suggest to check the **custom** section with isolated helm charts.
{% endhint %}

## Introduction

### Components

The CharlesCD installation considers these components:

1. Seven specific modules of **Charles' architecture;** 
2. **Keycloak**, used for product authentication and authorization;
3. A **PostgreSQL database** for backend modules \( `charles-application`, `charles-circle-matcher`, `deploy` and `villager`\) and Keycloak;
4. A **Redis**, to be used by [**Circle Matcher**](https://docs.charlescd.io/referencia/circle-matcher). 

### Continuous Delivery Platform

At this moment, Charles can support two Continuous Delivery \(CD\) platforms:

* **Spinnaker:** if you have your spinnaker already configured, you can proceed with our installation.  
* **Octopipe:** a native platform created by our team to make installation easier, without previous configurations. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want more information about how to configure Spinnaker or Octopipe, check the **CD Configuration** section.
{% endhint %}

## Main install cases

### Case \#1: Quick Installation

This installation is recommended for those who never used Charles before and just want a **first contact in testing environment**, without looking for scalability or security.

In this case, you will have to:

* Use an **yaml** file with all the **components**;
* Use a **Load Balancer** previously configured.

To create this structure, you have to execute the files in a configured cluster, such as minikube, GKE, EKS, etc. The steps to be executed are:

```text
kubectl create namespace charles

kubectl apply -f file.yaml
```

At the end of the process, you will have inside of namespace `charles` all the modules of the product, as well your dependencies installed in a simpler way.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The purpose of this installation is only for tests. Using this for production environment is not recommended due to lack o backup, high availability, etc.
{% endhint %}

### Case \#2: Customized installation

This installation is recommended for those who already has an infrastructure to deal with a more complex environment or who has some limitations of security/scalability, which demands a **more complete install customization** of CharlesCD.  

### Prerequisites 

To run the process, you must have the following programs:

* Kubectl
* Helm 

### How does it works?

This installation is recommended for who has already setup your infrastructure due to a more complex environment or have some security or/and scalability limitations, which demands a **more complete installation customization** from CharlesCD.

You can find here all this [**documentation of editable fields.**](https://github.com/ZupIT/charlescd/blob/master/install/helm-chart/) 

{% hint style="info" %}
It's important to remember that, in case of no customization at all, the final result is the same as in case \#1 in which, for standard, we install the PostgreSQL, Redis, Keycloak and Octopipe. 

So, you must not forget to customize the fields in case you want something manageable. 
{% endhint %}

To execute the installation, just run the command below after you customized the charts: 

```text
// customize everything you need in the file values.yaml before you execute the following command
helm install charlescd <repo-folder> -n <namespace>
```
